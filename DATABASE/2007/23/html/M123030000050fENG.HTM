is in use. To ensure that the gasket fully serves its purpose, it is necessary to observe some
precautions when applying the gasket. Bead size, continuity and location are of paramount importance.
Too thin a bead could cause leaks. Too thick a bead, on the other hand, could be squeezed out
of location, causing blocking or narrowing of the fluid feed line. To eliminate the possibility
of leaks from a joint, therefore, it is absolutely necessary to apply the gasket evenly without
a break, while observing the correct bead size.<br />Since the FIPG used in the transmission hardens as it reacts with the
moisture in the atmospheric air, it is normally used in the metallic flange areas.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>Disassembly</h3><br />The parts assembled with the FIPG can be easily disassembled without
use of a special method. In some cases, however, the sealant between the joined surfaces may
have broken by lightly striking with a mallet or similar tool. A flat and thin gasket scraper
may be lightly hammered in between the joined surfaces. In this case, however, care must be
taken to prevent damage to the joined surfaces.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>Surface preparation</h3><br />Thoroughly remove all substances deposited on the gasket application
surfaces, using a gasket scraper or wire brush. Check to ensure that the surfaces to which the
FIPG is to be applied is flat. Make sure that there are no oils, greases and foreign substances
deposited on the application surfaces. Do not forget to remove the old FIPG remaining in the
bolt holes.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>Form-in-place gasket application</h3><br />When assembling parts with the FIPG, you must observe some precautions,
but the procedures is very simple as in the case of a conventional precut gasket.<br />Applied FIPG bead should be of the specified size and without breaks.
Also be sure to encircle the bolt hole circumference with a completely continuous bead. The
FIPG can be wiped away unless it is hardened. While the FIPG is still moist (in less than 15
minutes), mount the parts in position. When the parts are mounted, make sure that the gasket
is applied to the required area only. In addition, do not apply any oil or water to the sealing
locations or start the engine until a sufficient amount of time (about one hour) has passed
after installation is completed.<br />The FIPG application procedure may vary on different areas. Observe
the procedure described in the text when applying the FIPG.<br /></body></html>
