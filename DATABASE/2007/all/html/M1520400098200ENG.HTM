and seat belt with pre-tensioner is designed to supplement the driver's and front passenger's
seat belts to help reduce the risk or severity of injury to the driver and front passenger by
activating and deploying both front air bags in certain frontal collisions.<br /></li><li type="1">The SRS and seat belt pre-tensioner systems consist of air bag modules, SRS-ECU,
two front impact sensors, two side impact sensors &#60;short wheelbase&#62;, four side impact sensors
&#60;long wheelbase&#62;, SRS warning lamp, clock spring, passenger&#8217;s air bag cut off switch,
passenger&#8217;s air bag off indicator lamp and seat belt pre-tensioner. Air bag modules
are installed at the centre of the steering wheel, on the globe box, front seatback and the
roof-side area (from the front pillars of driver- and passenger-side to the rear pillar in rear
area of vehicle). Each air bag has a safing folded air bag and an inflator. SRS-ECU, installed
at the depths of the centre console, monitors the system. The front impact sensor is assembled
in the radiator support panel to monitor collision upon frontal impact. The side impact sensor
is assembled in the centre pillar and quarter panel lower to monitor collision upon side impact.
The warning lamp on the instrument panel indicates the operational status of the SRS. The clock
spring is installed in the steering column. The passenger&#8217;s air bag cut off switch
is located above inside the glove box. The passenger&#8217;s air bag off indicator lamp is
installed in centre air outlet. The seat belt pre-tensioner is incorporated in the seat belt retractor. <br /></li><li type="1">Only authorized service personnel should do work on or around the SRS components.
Those service personnel should read this manual carefully before starting any such work.<br /></li></ul><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/52/ZC6024030001ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/52/ZC6024030001ENG.png"></img></a><br /></body></html>
