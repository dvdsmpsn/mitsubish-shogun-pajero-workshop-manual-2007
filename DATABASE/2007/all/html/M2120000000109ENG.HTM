After its pressure is regulated by the relief valve, the oil passes through the oil filter.
Then, it flows from the oil passage in the cylinder block to the individual crankshaft journals
and the cylinder head.<br />After the oil is pumped to the individual crankshaft journals, it passes through a passage
in the crankshaft and is fed to the pins. After the oil is pumped to the cylinder head, it flows
to the camshaft journals and the oil feeder control valves.<br /></body></html>
