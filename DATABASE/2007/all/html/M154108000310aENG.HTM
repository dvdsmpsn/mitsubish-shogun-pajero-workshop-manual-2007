Check the state of the antenna.</b><h1></h1><h3>Q.
           Is the mast antenna assembled?</h3><a href="#S2"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" /></a>Go to Step 2.<br /><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" />Assemble the mast antenna. Check that there is no noise.<br /><a name="S2"></a><b>STEP 2. The check after adjusting the radio.</b><h1></h1><h3>Q.
           Readjust the radio. Is the noise eliminated?</h3><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" /> Check that there is no noise.<br /><a href="#S3"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" /></a>Go to Step 3.<br /><a name="S3"></a><b>STEP 3. Check with several broadcasting stations.</b><h1></h1><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff">Multipath noise and fading noise: Because of the frequency of FM waves in extremely high,
it is highly susceptible to effects from geological formations and buildings. These effects
disrupt the broadcast signal and obstruct reception in several ways.<br /><b>Multipath noise</b><br /><ul><li type="1">This describes the echo that occurs when the broadcast signal is reflected by a
large obstruction and enters the receiver with a slight time delay relative to the direct signal
(repetitious buzzing).<br /></li></ul><b>Fading noise</b><br /><ul><li type="1">This is a buzzing noise that occurs when the broadcast beam is disrupted by obstructing objects
and the signal strength fluctuates intricately within a narrow range.<br /></li></ul></td></tr></table><h3>Q.
           Is the abnormality in reception generated only within a certain range?</h3><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" />The effect of an electrical field condition (multipath noise, fading noise) could
be the cause. Check that there is not noise.<br /><a href="#S4"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" /></a>Go to Step 4.<br /><a name="S4"></a><b>STEP 4. Check that noise appears when the radio switch is turned on
while the vehicle is stopped.</b><h1></h1><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff">Static electricity noise: Body static electric from the shock absorber rubber bushings
used to prevent vibration, tires, etc. occurs because of separation from the earth, causing
a buzzing noise. There is no measures to discharge the static electricity of the vehicle body.
Check that there is no noise.<br /></td></tr></table><h3>Q.
          Does noise appear when the radio switch is turned on while the vehicle is stopped
and the radio is tapped while tuned away from a station?</h3><a href="#S5"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" /></a>Go to Step 5.<br /><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" />It may be static electricity noise.<br /><a name="S5"></a><b>STEP 5. Check that the radio is correctly earthed.</b><h1></h1>The radio is connected to the earth with an assembling screw.<br /><h3>Q.
          Is the radio correctly earthed? </h3><a href="#S6"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" /></a>Go to Step 6.<br /><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" />Tighten the screw securely. Check that there is no noise.<br /><a name="S6"></a><b>STEP 6. Check by replacing the radio and tape player or CD player.</b><h1></h1><h3>Q.
           Are operations normal when using another radio and CD player?</h3><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" />Either repair or replace the radio and CD player. Check that there is no noise.<br /><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" />Either repair or replace the antenna assembly. Check that there is no noise.<br /></body></html>
