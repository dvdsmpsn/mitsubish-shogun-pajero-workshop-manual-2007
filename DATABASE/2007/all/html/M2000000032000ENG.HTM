The structures also have the following features:<br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/00/ZC6030610000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/00/ZC6030610000ENG.png"></img></a><br /><b></b><br /><ol><li type="1">The crush box structure has been adopted to the front end of the sidemember to improve the characteristics at a minor frontal collision.<br /></li><li type="1">Closed-crosssectional construction has been used for the front roof rail, the roof bow center and the rear roof rail to improve vehicle body ridigity and suppress vibration and noise.<br /></li><li type="1">An annular construction has been used for the side structure reinforcement to improve collision safety and vehicle body ridigity.<br /></li><li type="1">The front frame structure is supported in three directions by the dash crossmember center, dash crossmember lower, and front sidemember rear in order to improve the frontal collision characteristics, and increase the vehicle body rigidity.<br /></li><li type="1">The front sidemember structure has been changed to a straight frame structure with a hexagon cross section in order to improve the collision characteristics.<br /></li><li type="1">The padding structure of the fender bracket has been adopted to efficiently absorb energy upon impact and improve the pedestrian protection capability.<br /></li><li type="1">The impact absorbing opening on the cowl top outer panel has been added to efficiently absorb energy upon impact and improve the pedestrian protection capability.<br /></li></ol><hr width="90%" /><h2>SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM (SRS) </h2><br />The driver&#8217;s and passenger&#8217;s (front) air bags, side-airboats, curtain air bags and seat belts with pre-tensioner have been standard equipped on all vehicles.<br />Dual stage air bag system has been adopted to both driver and front passenger sides. This is consisted of the front impact sensor, SRS-ECU and dual stage inflator. Air bag is deployed in two stages according to the strength of impact received.<br />An inflator that does not contain sodium azide has been adopted for all types of the air bag modules.<br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/00/ZC6008500000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/00/ZC6008500000ENG.png"></img></a><br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>SRS FRONT AIR BAG</h3><br />Front air bag is designed to supplement the front seat belts.

The seat belt incorporating the pre-tensioner automatically winds the seatbelt upon front impact to reduce forward shifting of the driver&#8217;s and passenger&#8217;s.<br /></body></html>
