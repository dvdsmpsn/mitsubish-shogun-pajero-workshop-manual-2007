supply pump.<br /></li></ul><hr width="90%" /><h2>CONSTRUCTION DESCRIPTION</h2><br />The drive force for the supply pump travels from the gear that is mounted on the crankshaft,
via an idler gear, to the supply pump camshaft. The rotational movement of the supply pump camshaft
drives the feed pump and the plungers. The driving of the feed pump causes the fuel to be drawn
up from the fuel tank. The driving of the plungers pressurizes the fuel that is stored in the
high-pressure chamber. There are two plungers, which are arranged in such a way that when one
is in the suction stroke, the other is in the pumping stroke.<br /><br /><b>Operation Diagram</b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/13/ZK602569AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/13/ZK602569AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br />The fuel that is delivered from the feed pump is drawn into the high-pressure chamber,
which is located at the side of the plunger that is in the suction stroke. Then, as the camshaft
rotates, it starts the pumping stroke and pressurizes the fuel in the high-pressure chamber.
When this exceeds the fuel pressure in the common rail, the delivery valve opens, pumping the
fuel into the common rail. The two plungers repeat these strokes alternately. Consequently,
as the injectors inject fuel twice per revolution of the engine, the supply pump also pumps
twice. Thus, it is able to maintain a constant fuel pressure in the common rail.<br /><hr width="90%" /><table class="fontttl5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%"></td><td width="65%" valign="top"><h2>SUCTION CONTROL VALVE</h2><br /></td></tr></table><table class="fontmain5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%" valign="top"><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/13/ZK602570AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl250" width="250" src="../../../IMG/13/ZK602570AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br /></td><td width="65%" valign="top">Suction control valve is installed in the fuel passage between the feed pump and the suction
valve. A type of solenoid valve in which the opening of the valve varies in accordance with
the amount of the actuating current, the suction control valve regulates the amount of fuel
that is delivered by the feed pump to the high-pressure chamber.<br />When the amount of actuating current is small, the opening of the suction control valve
becomes small, thus reducing the amount of fuel that is delivered to the high-pressure chamber. As
a result, the amount of fuel that is pumped to the common rail is reduced.<br />When the amount of actuating current is large, the opening of the suction control valve
becomes large, thus increasing the amount of fuel that is delivered to the high-pressure chamber. As
a result, the amount of fuel that is pumped to the common rail is increased.<br />By varying the amount of actuating current to the solenoid valve in accordance with the
running conditions of the engine, the engine-ECU controls the amount of fuel that is delivered
to the high-pressure chamber.<br /></td></tr></table><table class="fonttbl5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%" /><td width="65%" valign="top"><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/13/ZK602571AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl600" width="600" src="../../../IMG/13/ZK602571AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br /></td></tr></table></body></html>
