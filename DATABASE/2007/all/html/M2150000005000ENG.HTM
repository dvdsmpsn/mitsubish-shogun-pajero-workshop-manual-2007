the primary port. and the secondary port. The control valve has been installed to the secondary
port, and this control valve is opened or closed through the vacuum actuator depending on the
engine speed. That is an air intake control system which has been adopted. This system has prevented
the typical 4-valve engine low performance at the low speed and improved the fuel economy within
the range of the low to the middle speed. That is, this system uses the primary port only at
the low speed and then makes the intake airflow speed high, so increases the inertia supercharging
effect.<br /><br /><hr width="90%" /><table class="fontttl5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%"></td><td width="65%" valign="top"><h2>INLET MANIFOLD &#60;4M41&#62;</h2><br /></td></tr></table><table class="fontmain5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%" valign="top"><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/15/ZK602473AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl250" width="250" src="../../../IMG/15/ZK602473AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br /></td><td width="65%" valign="top">This 4M41 is designed to be a cross flow to improve an intake efficiency.<br />An inlet manifold corresponding to the cross flow is used.<br /></td></tr></table><br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>SWIRL CONTROL VALVE &#60;4M41&#62;</h2><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/15/ZK602472AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/15/ZK602472AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br />The swirl control valve closes one of the intake ports during intake stroke. This creates
a strong swirl inside the cylinder. The swirl in turn generates vortices in the air-fuel mixture
introduced through the intake port.<br />The swirl moment remains working even during the subsequent compression stroke and increases
the propagation speed of flame, thus helping combustion to be more stabilized<br /></body></html>
