gears can be engaged in the correct positions when they are installed.<br />The timing chain is an endless chain consisting of 110 links which is installed to the camshaft
sprockets to the idler sprocket.<br />The timing chain has three mark link plates (glossy yellow) which are used to ensure that
the crankshaft and camshaft are installed in the correct timing positions. There are two plates
installed in position A and one plate in position B. For correct installation, the two plate
at position A should be aligned with the "O" marks on the camshaft sprockets and the single
plate at position B should be aligned with the "O" marks on the idler sprocket.<br />The tension of the timing chain is regulated by the tensioner. The tensioner includes
a plunger, has a built-in plunger spring inside it.<br />When the tensioner is installed, the plunger directly presses against the tension lever
and the tension of the timing chain is determined automatically by the force of the plunger
spring and hydraulic pressure.<br />A cam is used to lock the plunger in position after installation, in order to prevent
any runout in the timing chain when it is being driven. Care should be taken if cranking the
engine anti-clockwise (reverse direction) after the tensioner has been installed, as this can
cause excessive force to be applied to the plunger, which can in turn cause problems such as slippage
of the cam.<br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>CYLINDER HEAD</h2><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/11/ZK6001980000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/11/ZK6001980000ENG.png"></img></a><br />The cylinder head is a DOHC and corresponds to a cross flow. <br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>ROCKER COVER</h2><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/11/ZK6001990000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/11/ZK6001990000ENG.png"></img></a><br />Corresponding to the common rail system, a rocker cover gasket has a favorable construction
