           Is the mast antenna assembled?</h3><a href="#S2"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" /></a>Go to Step 2.<br /><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" />Assemble the mast antenna. Check that a poor reception is resolved.<br /><a name="S2"></a><b>STEP 2. Check to see if inspections are taking place is an area exposed
to special electric fields.</b><h1></h1><h3>Q.
           Are inspections taking place under special electric field conditions (underneath
garage, inside a building, etc).?</h3><a href="#S3"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" /></a>Go to Step 3.<br /><a href="#S4"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" /></a>Go to Step 4.<br /><a name="S3"></a><b>STEP 3. Relocate and check.</b><h1></h1>Automatically receive in a good reception area that is not exposed to special electric
fields.<br /><h3>Q.
           Is reception of the strongest radio frequency possible within the area?</h3><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" />Check that a poor reception is resolved.<br /><a href="#S4"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" /></a>Go to Step 4.<br /><a name="S4"></a><b>STEP 4. Tune then check.</b><h1></h1><h3>Q.
           Did the sensitivity improve after tuning?</h3><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" />Check that a poor reception is resolved.<br /><a href="#S5"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" /></a>Go to Step 5.<br /><a name="S5"></a><b>STEP 5. Check with several broadcasting stations.</b><h1></h1><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff">Multipath noise and fading noise: Because the frequency of FM waves is extremely high,
it is highly susceptible to effects from geological formations and buildings. These effects
disrupt the broadcast signal and obstruct reception in several ways. <br /><b>Multipath noise</b><br /><ul><li type="1">This describes the echo that occurs when the broadcast signal is reflected by a
large obstruction and enters the receiver with a slight time delay relative to the direct signal
(repetitious buzzing).<br /></li></ul><b>Fading noise</b><br /><ul><li type="1">This is a buzzing noise that occurs when the broadcast beam is disrupted by obstructing objects
and the signal strength fluctuates intricately within a narrow range.<br /></li></ul></td></tr></table><h3>Q.
           Is the abnormality in reception generated only within a certain range?</h3><img src="../../../buttons/03btn001.png" />Check that a poor reception is resolved.<br /><a href="#S6"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn002.png" /></a>Go to Step 6.<br /><a name="S6"></a><b>STEP 6.
