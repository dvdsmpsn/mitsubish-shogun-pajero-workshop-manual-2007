Even after the ignition switch is turned OFF, the door mirrors remain operable for 30 seconds.<br />If the folding&#47;unfolding switch on the remote control mirror switch is turned ON while one of the door mirror relays (fold&#47;unfold) is in operation, the other operating relay is turned ON after 0.1 seconds.<br /><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff">Whether the door mirrors are at the folding or unfolding position is determined by ETACS according to the memory of the door mirror relay position (fold&#47;unfold) operated previously.
