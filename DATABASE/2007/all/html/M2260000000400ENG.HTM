clutch gear, shift rod, and shift fork, etc.<br /></li><li type="1">The freewheel clutch assembly is electrically and automatically controlled utilizing an
ON/OFF signal from the 4WD detection switch which is located in the transfer.<br /></li><li type="1">The solenoid valves are either activated or deactivated to change the passage of
vacuum to the actuator according to the ON/OFF signal. Operated by the actuator, via the shift
rod and shift fork, the clutch sleeve slides to either 2WD or 4WD position to select the drive train
mode.<br /></li><li type="1">A vacuum tank is incorporated to provide a better freewheel clutch operation.<br /></li></ul><br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>CONSTRUCTION DIAGRAM</h2><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/26/ZC6004580000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/26/ZC6004580000ENG.png"></img></a><br /><br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>FREEWHEEL CLUTCH OPERATION</h2><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/26/ZC6004770000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/26/ZC6004770000ENG.png"></img></a><br /><b>2WD</b><br />When the transfer is moved to the 2WD position, both solenoid valve A and B turn on and chamber
