drops from entering via the upper side. If water should be entered, it is drained through the
hole located on the lower area of the switch. No water may be accumulated.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>ANTI-TRAPPING FUNCTION </h3><br />The power window with the safety mechanism is adopted. If any obstacle such as a hand
or a head is detected to be trapped during a window glass closing operation, the window glass
is opened by approximately 150 mm to improve safety.<br /><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff">If anti-trapping function is activated consecutively three times or more, the fully closed position
that power window switch has learned will be erased. With this state, auto-up&#47;down
function becomes in effective. To make the power window switch learn the fully closed position
the initialization is required. Please refer to Workshop Manual for how to initialize.<br /></td></tr></table><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>POWER WINDOW SWITCH</h3><br /><b></b><br /><ul><li type="1">The power window switch employs the push-pull operation
method to improve safety. To open a door window glass, press in the switch knob, and to close,
pull it up.<br /></li><li type="1">The one-touch mechanism is adopted to the driver's power window switch to fully
open or close any door window glass in a single operation.<br /></li></ul><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>POWER WINDOW TIMER FUNCTION</h3><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/42/ZC6007240001ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/42/ZC6007240001ENG.png"></img></a><br />When the power window relay is turned ON with the ignition switch ON, the power window
relay is kept ON for 30 seconds even after the ignition switch is turned OFF, enabling the door
window to be opened and closed with the power window switch.<br />If the driver's door is opened during the timer operation, the power window relay is kept
ON for 30 seconds from that time. However, when the driver's door is closed, the power window
relay is turned OFF at the same time.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>POWER WINDOW LOCK SWITCH</h3><br />The driver power window switch is equipped with the lock switch. This switch inhibits
the opening&#47;closing operation of the door window glass by the front passenger's power
window switch or rear power window switches &#60;Long wheelbase&#62;. Using a customisation feature&#42;,
the lock switch operation can be configured to "All SW operation" or "Only main SW." The initial
setting at factory is "All SW operation."<br /><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff">&#42;:Using a customisation feature, the power window lock switch operation can be
changed. Refer to <a href="javascript:JumpPage('M2420000024100ENG.HTM')"><img src="../../../buttons/03btn007.png" /></a>.<br /></td></tr></table></body></html>
