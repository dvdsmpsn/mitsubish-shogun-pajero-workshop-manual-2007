via port A, port B. Hydraulic pressure supplied via port A is then fed to the torque converter pressure
control valve (and thence to the torque converter) via port C. Also, line pressure that has
passed through the manual valve is supplied to the regulator valve via port D. When line pressure
is supplied via port B, port D, and port E, the surface area of land &#35;3 causes the
valve to be pushed toward the left. The counteraction of this force by the spring effectively
regulates the line pressure. Any increase in engine speed (and thus also in oil pump speed) causes
a concomitant increase in the hydraulic pressure acting upon port B, port D, and port E. This
increased pressure overcomes the spring and pushes the valve toward the left. The fluid passage
leading to the torque converter (labelled "a" in the drawing) is thus widened, and more fluid
is supplied to the torque converter.<br />Any further increase in hydraulic pressure causes the valve to be pushed
further toward the left. When this occurs, fluid passage "b" is opened. This allows pressure
to escape to the oil pump side and thus lowers the line pressure. Any decrease in the line pressure
causes a concomitant decrease in the hydraulic pressure acting upon port B, port D, and port
E. When this occurs, the spring pushes the valve back toward the right, thereby closing fluid
passage "b." The overall effect of this mechanism is to maintain the line pressure at a constant
level. If the line pressure exceeds the regulated pressure from the regulator valve, the relief
valve in line A allows pressure to escape and thereby protects the hydraulic circuit.<br /></li><li type="1">First and Second Gears<br />Line pressure is supplied via port A and port B. Thus, the leftward force
on the valve results from the line pressure multiplied by the difference between the surface
areas of land &#35;1 and land &#35;3. The effective surface area of only land &#35;4
is smaller than in 1 &#91;parking and neutral&#93;, so there is less leftward force
on the valve per unit of pressure. As a result, fluid passage "b" stays open under greater pressure
than in 1, causing a concomitant increase in line pressure. The regulator valve responds to
increases in line pressure as described in 1.<br /></li><li type="1">Third, Fourth and Fifth Gears<br />Line pressure is supplied via port F in addition to that supplied from
port B and port D. Thus the leftward force on the valve is that caused by the surface area difference between
land &#35;1 and land &#35;4. Land &#35;4 has a greater surface area than land &#35;3,
so the leftward force on the valve per unit of pressure is greater than in 2 &#91;1st and
2nd gears&#93;. As a result fluid passage "b" opens under less pressure than in 2, causing
a concomitant reduction in line pressure. The regulator valve responds to increases in line
pressure as described in 1.<br /></li><li type="1">Reverse<br />When the "R" range is selected, thus cutting the supply of line pressure
to port D. Therefore, the leftward force on the valve is that resulting from the surface area
difference between land &#35;1 and land &#35;2. Since land &#35;1 has a smaller surface
area than land &#35;2, the leftward force acting on the valve per unit of pressure is smaller
than in 2 &#91;1st and 2nd gears&#93;. As a result, fluid passage "b" does not open
unless the pressure is higher than in 2, and the line pressure increases concomitantly. Thus,
the high line pressure required for reversing is applied to the operating elements. The regulator
valve responds to increases in line pressure as described in 1.<br /></li></ol></td></tr></table><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><table class="fontttl5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%"></td><td width="65%" valign="top"><h2>Torque Converter Pressure Control Valve</h2><br /></td></tr></table><table class="fontmain5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%"></td><td width="65%" valign="top">The torque converter pressure control valve keeps constant the fluid

the surface difference between land &#35;5 and land &#35;6&#62;. As a result, the valve
is pushed toward the left. This causes port D to open, so hydraulic pressure is supplied from
the 2ND pressure control valve to the 2ND brake. <br /></li><li type="1">THIRD GEAR AND FOURTH GEAR <br />In addition to port A, hydraulic pressure is supplied to port B. Pressure
is supplied also to port E. Thus, the force resulting from the hydraulic pressure acting upon
land &#35;1 overcomes the force resulting from the surface area difference between land &#35;4
and land &#35;6. As a result, the valve is pushed toward the left.<br /></li><li type="1">FIFTH GEAR<br />In addition to port A, hydraulic pressure is supplied to port C and port
E. Thus, the force resulting from the hydraulic pressure acting upon land &#35;1 overcomes
the sum of &#60;the force resulting from the hydraulic pressure acting upon the surface area
difference between land &#35;2 and land &#35;3&#62; and &#60;the force resulting from the
hydraulic pressure acting upon the surface area difference between land &#35;4 and land &#35;5&#62;. As
a result, the valve is pushed toward the left. This causes port D to open, so hydraulic pressure
is supplied from the 2ND pressure control valve to the 2ND brake.<br /></li><li type="1">REVERSE<br />In addition to port A, line pressure from the manual valve is supplied
from port F to a chamber at the right-hand side of the valve. Thus, the surface areas of land &#35;1
and land &#35;6 cause the valve to be pushed to right.<br /></li><li type="1">FAIL-SAFE OPERATION (CONTROL RELAY OFF)<br />In the event of a fail-safe condition, the solenoid valve is turned OFF,
so hydraulic pressure is supplied to port C. Thus, the force resulting from the hydraulic pressure
acting upon land &#35;1 overcomes the sum of &#60;the force resulting from the surface area
difference between land &#35;2 and land &#35;3&#62; and &#60;the force resulting from the
surface area difference between land &#35;4 and land &#35;6&#62;. As a result, port D
is connected to port G the 2ND brake hydraulic pressure is released. Also, the hydraulic pressure
from the 2ND pressure control valve is cut by fail-safe valve B.<br /></li></ol></td></tr></table><hr width="90%" /><table class="fontttl5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%"></td><td width="65%" valign="top"><h2>FAIL-SAFE VALVE C</h2><br /></td></tr></table><table class="fontmain5" border="0" width="90%"><tr><td width="35%"></td><td width="65%" valign="top">At fail-safe condition (control relay OFF), this valve cuts the oil pressure
