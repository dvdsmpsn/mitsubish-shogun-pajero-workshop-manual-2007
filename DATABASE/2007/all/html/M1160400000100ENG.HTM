by preheating the glow plug at super speed. When the ignition switch is turned to the ON position,
the engine-ECU supplies electric currents and controls the glow lamp illumination in accordance
with the engine coolant temperature. The control resistance wire built in the glow plug has
a higher resistance as the glow plug temperature becomes higher. Because of this, the currents
in the heater wire gradually decrease. The glow plug is stabilized at the specified temperature. After
the engine start at low temperature, the current going to the glow plug is controlled to perform
the stable combustion.<br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/16/ZK603125AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/16/ZK603125AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br /></body></html>
