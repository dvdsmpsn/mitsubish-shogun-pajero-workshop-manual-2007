low-reverse brake&#42;, the reduction brake and the one-way clutch (OWC-D) are participating.
The driving force from the input shaft is transmitted to the underdrive sun gear via the underdrive
clutch. The driving force transmitted to the underdrive sun gear via the output pinion turns the
low reverse annulus gear clockwise and at the same time turns the output planetary carrier counterclockwise
with the fashion that the output pinion revolves around the underdrive sun gear. However, since
the one-way clutch (OWC-L) and the low-reverse brake&#42; are engaged at this time, the
low-reverse annulus gear is locked and the output planetary carrier only rotates counterclockwise.
This driving force turns the direct pinion counterclockwise via the direct annulus gear. Since
the direct sun gear is locked by the one-way clutch, the direct planetary carrier rotates counterclockwise
with the fashion that the direct pinion revolves around the direct sun gear to obtain reduction
ratio of the first gear. Since the output planetary carrier is connected to the output annulus
gear, the overdrive pinion gear is driven at the same time. However, since the overdrive planetary
carrier is locked by the one-way clutch (OWC-L) and the reverse sun gear is free to rotate,
it runs idle and has no effect on the rotation of the output planetary carrier.<br /><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff">&#42;: The low-reverse brake is activated only when the vehicle is stationary (10

brake and the one-way clutch (OWC-D) are participating. The second brake is operated under the
first gear condition, the reverse sun gear is locked and the driving force from the output annulus
gear turns the overdrive planetary carrier counterclockwise with the fashion that the overdrive
pinion revolves around the reverse sun gear. Since the overdrive planetary carrier is connected
with the low-reverse annulus gear, the low-reverse annulus gear also rotates counterclockwise.
This rotation of the low-reverse annulus gear is transmitted to the direct annulus gear via
the output pinion, however, since the elements of the direct planetary gear are the same as
that of the first gear, rotation amount of the low-reverse annulus gear is added to the rotation
of the output planetary carrier to obtain the reduction ratio of the second gear.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>3rd gear</h3><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/23/ZC6026670000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/23/ZC6026670000ENG.png"></img></a><br />When the 3rd gear is selected, the underdrive clutch,   the overdrive clutch, the reduction
brake and the one-way clutch (OWC-D) are participating. Since the overdrive clutch connects
the input shaft with the overdrive planetary carrier and the low reverse annulus gear, the rotation
speed of the underdrive sun gear that is connected with the input shaft by the underdrive clutch
and the rotation speed of the low-reverse annulus gear become equal. Under this condition, the
planetary gear set is locked and rotates as one body to transmit the driving force to the direct
annulus gear. The operation of the direct planetary carrier elements is the same as the first gear,
therefore, the reduction ratio of the third gear is obtained by the configuration that the planetary
gear set rotates as one body under locked condition.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>4th gear</h3><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/23/ZC6026680000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/23/ZC6026680000ENG.png"></img></a><br />When the 4th gear is selected, the underdrive clutch, the overdrive clutch and the direct
clutch are participating. The operating condition of input shaft elements is the same as that
of the third gear, where the planetary gear set is locked to rotate as one body. The driving
force input to the output planetary carrier is transmitted from the direct annulus gear connected
with the output planetary carrier, via the direct pinion, to the direct sun gear and turns it clockwise.
On the other hand, since the direct sun gear is connected with the direct planetary carrier
by the direct clutch, they rotate counterclockwise as one body to obtain the reduction ratio
of the fourth gear.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>5th gear</h3><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/23/ZC6026690000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/23/ZC6026690000ENG.png"></img></a><br />When the 5th gear is selected, the overdrive clutch, the direct clutch and the second
brake are participating. The driving force of the input shaft is transmitted to the overdrive
planetary carrier via the reverse clutch. On the other hand, since the reverse sun gear is locked
by the second brake, rotation amount of the overdrive pinion that revolves around the reverse
sun gear is added to the rotation of the overdrive planetary carrier and the resultant rotation is
transmitted to the output annulus gear. This driving force is then transmitted to the output
planetary carrier that is connected to the overdrive planetary carrier and the direct annulus
gear. Since the operating elements of the direct planetary carrier are the same as that of the
fourth gear, the reduction ratio of the fifth gear is obtained by the revolution of the overdrive
pinion.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>Reverse</h3><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/23/ZC6026700000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/23/ZC6026700000ENG.png"></img></a><br />When the reverse gear is selected, the reverse clutch, the low-reverse brake and the reduction brake
are participation. The driving force of the input shaft is transmitted to the reverse sun gear
via the reverse clutch. On the other hand, since the overdrive planetary carrier is locked by
the low-reverse brake, the driving force of the reverse sun gear is transmitted to the output
annulus gear via the overdrive pinion as the clockwise rotating force. This driving force is
then transmitted to the direct annulus gear via the output planetary carrier. Since the direct sun
gear is locked by the reduction brake, rotation amount of the direct pinion that revolves around
the direct sun gear is added to rotate the direct planetary carrier clockwise. Thus the reduction
ratio of reverse gear is obtained. At this time, the output pinion is driven by the output planetary
carrier, however, since the underdrive sun gear is free to rotate, it runs idle and has no effect
on the rotation of the output planetary carrier.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>Parking and neutral</h3><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/23/ZC6026710000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/23/ZC6026710000ENG.png"></img></a><br />In parking and neutral, all of the clutches are disengaged and driving force from the
input shaft is not transmitted to the planetary carrier. To enable a quick shift to 1st gear
or reverse, the low-reverse brake and reduction brake is operational.<br /></body></html>
