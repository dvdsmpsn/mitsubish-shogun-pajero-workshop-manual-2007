standard for a serial multiplex communication protocol<sup>&#42;</sup>. A communication circuit
employing the CAN protocol connects each electric control module (ECU), and sensor data can be
shared among, which enables more reduction in wiring.<br /><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff"><sup>&#42;</sup>: The regulations have been decided in detail, from software matters
such as the necessary transmission rate for communication, the system, data format, and communication
timing control method to hardware matters such as the harness type and length and the resistance
values.<br /></td></tr></table><hr width="90%" />CAN offers the following advantages.<br /><b></b><br /><ul><li type="1">Transmission rates are much faster than those in conventional
communication (up to 1 Mbps), allowing much more data to be sent.<br /></li><li type="1">It is exceptionally immune to noise, and the data obtained from each error detection
device is more reliable.<br /></li><li type="1">Each ECU connected via the CAN communicates independently, therefore if the ECU
enters damaged mode, communications can be continued in some cases.<br /></li></ul></body></html>
