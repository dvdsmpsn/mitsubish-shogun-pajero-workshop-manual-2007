fats from the skin, leading to dryness, irritation and dermatitis. In addition, used engine
oil contains potentially harmful contaminants which may cause skin cancer. Adequate means of
skin protection and washing facilities must be provided.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>RECOMMENDED PRECAUTIONS</h3><br />The most effective precaution is to adapt working practices which prevent, as far as practicable,
the risk of skin contact with mineral oils, for example by using enclosed systems for handling used
engine oil and by degreasing components, where practicable, before handling them. Other precautions:<br /><b></b><br /><ul><li type="1">Avoid prolonged and repeated contact with oils, particularly used engine
oils.<br /></li><li type="1">Wear protective clothing, including impervious gloves where practicable.<br /></li><li type="1">Avoid contaminating clothes, particularly underpants, with oil.<br /></li><li type="1">Do not put oily rags in pockets, the use of overalls without pockets will avoid this.<br /></li><li type="1">Do not wear heavily soiled clothing and oil-impregnated foot-wear. Overalls must
be cleaned regularly and kept separate from personal clothing.<br /></li><li type="1">Where there is a risk of eye contact, eye protection should be worn, for example,
chemical goggles or face shields; in addition an eye wash facility should be provided.<br /></li><li type="1">Obtain first aid treatment immediately for open cuts and wounds.<br /></li><li type="1">Wash regularly with soap and water to ensure all oil is removed, especially before
meals (skin cleansers and nail brushes will help). After cleaning, the application of preparations
containing lanolin to replace the natural skin oils is advised.<br /></li><li type="1">Do not use petrol, kerosine, diesel fuel, gas oil, thinners or solvents for cleaning skin.<br /></li><li type="1">Use barrier creams, applying them before each work period, to help the removal of oil
from the skin after work.<br /></li><li type="1">If skin disorders develop, obtain medical advice without delay.<br /></li></ul></body></html>
