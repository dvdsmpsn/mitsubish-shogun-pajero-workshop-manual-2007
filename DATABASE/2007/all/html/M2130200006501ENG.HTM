driven. Also, because 2 relays are provided in series it is possible to supply power synchronized
with the ignition switch. This ensures stability and power is supplied directly from the battery.
When the ignition switch-ST signal is input, engine-A/T-ECU turns ON the power transistor for
control of the fuel pump relay. As a result, power is supplied to the fuel pump. Also, if engine
speed falls below a set value, the fuel pump relay is turned OFF. Thus, it deals with sudden stoppages
such as engine stalling etc. by stopping the pump.<br /></body></html>
