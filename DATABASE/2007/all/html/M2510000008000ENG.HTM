looking.<br /></li><li type="1">The wiper interval fixed type intermittent wiper has been adopted, thus improving
a clear rear view in rainy weather.<br /></li><li type="1">The rear wiper moves a couple of times at low speed when the switch is turned on
(initial continuous movement), and operates at a fixed interval afterwards to provide a clear
rear view in rainy weather.<br /></li><li type="1"> When the rear wiper switch is in the intermittent position and the gear in reverse,
the rear wiper will continuously wipe 2 to 3 times in low speed after about 1 second, and thereafter
continue with intermittent wiping with the reverse interlocked wiper function employed.<br /></li><li type="1">The washer-linked wiper function&#42; has been introduced. The washer fluid
can be injected without operating the wiper optionally. When the ignition switch is turned ON
with the washer switch ON, the washer motor operates but the wiper does not.<br /></li><li type="1">The rear wiper washer tank located inside the back door is independent from the
