section of the auto-cruise control system inside the engine-ECU receives the input signals of the
auto-cruise control switch, vehicle speed and cancel system (stop lamp switch and inhibitor switch).
To the engine control section it sends the target accelerator pedal opening angle value for auto-cruise
control system, to the A&#47;T control section it issues a command to cancel over drive,
and to the gauge it issues an ON&#47;OFF command for the auto-cruise control indicator
lamp.<br />In the engine control section, the target throttle valve opening angle value is calculated
from the target accelerator pedal opening angle value for auto-cruise control system and the
actual accelerator angle value, and the vehicle speed is controlled by applying the throttle
actuator control motor.<br /><b>BLOCK DIAGRAM</b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/17/ZC6028300000ENG.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/17/ZC6028300000ENG.png"></img></a><br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>SYSTEM OUTLINE &#60;4M4&#62;</h2><br />The engine-ECU calculates the target accelerator opening angle at the cruise control section

            </b>While driving in the vehicle speed range of approximately 40 to 165 km&#47;h,
press the "COAST&#47;SET" switch, and release the hand from the "COAST&#47;SET" switch.<br /><b>2.
            </b>The cruise control system stores the vehicle speed when the "COAST&#47;SET" switch
is released, and then performs a constant speed driving at the stored vehicle speed.<br /><b>3.
            </b>When the "COAST&#47;SET" switch is operated while driving at the vehicle speed
of approximately 165 km&#47;h or faster, the constant speed driving is not performed.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>COST FUNCTION</h3><br /><b>1.
            </b>When the "COAST&#47;SET" switch is pressed for 0.5 seconds or more during the constant
speed driving, the throttle valve is fully closed while the switch is pressed, and the vehicle
is decelerated.<br /><b>2.
            </b>After that, when the hand is released from the "COAST&#47;SET" switch, the vehicle
speed of that time is newly stored, and then the constant speed driving is performed at that speed.<br /><b>3.
            </b>In addition, when the "COAST&#47;SET" switch is pressed for less than 0.5 seconds,
the vehicle speed is decreased by 1.6 km&#47;h from that of the constant speed driving.
The decelerated speed is newly stored, and then the constant speed driving is performed at that speed.<br /><b>4.
            </b>When the "COAST&#47;SET" switch is pressed and held, and the vehicle speed is decelerated
to approximately 40 km&#47;h or less, the set function and coast function are released,
and the constant speed driving is cancelled.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>RESUME FUNCTION</h3><br /><b>1.
            </b>During the constant speed driving, press the "CANCEL" switch, or depress the brake pedal
or clutch pedal to cancel the constant speed driving.<br /><b>2.
            </b>Afterward, when the "ACC&#47;RES" switch is pressed while driving at a vehicle
speed of approximately 40 km&#47;h or more, a constant speed driving is performed at the
vehicle speed stored when the constant speed driving was cancelled.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>ACCELE FUNCTION</h3><br /><b>1.
            </b>During the constant speed driving, when the "ACC&#47;RES" switch is pressed and
held for 0.5 seconds or longer, the vehicle is accelerated with the specified acceleration while the
switch is pressed.<br /><b>2.
            </b>After that, when the hand is released from the "ACC&#47;RES" switch, the vehicle
speed of that time is newly stored, and then the constant speed driving is performed at that speed.<br /><b>3.
            </b>In addition when the "ACC&#47;RES" switch is pressed for less than 0.5 seconds,
the vehicle speed is increased by 1.6 km&#47;h from that of the constant speed driving.
The accelerated vehicle speed is newly stored, and then the constant speed driving is performed
at that speed.<br /><b>4.
            </b>It is possible to accelerate the vehicle speed to approximately 165 km&#47;h
or more by pressing and holding the "ACC&#47;RES" switch. However, after the hand is released
from the "ACC&#47;RES" switch, the vehicle speed of approximately 165 km&#47;h becomes
a newly stored vehicle speed, and then the constant speed driving is performed at that speed.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>CANCEL FUNCTION</h3><br />When any one of the following conditions is met, the constant speed driving will be cancelled.<br /><b></b><br /><ul><li type="1">The "ON&#47;OFF" (MAIN) switch is pressed to cancel
the auto-cruise control system.<br /></li><li type="1">The "CANCEL" switch is pressed.<br /></li><li type="1">The brake pedal is depressed.<br /></li><li type="1">The clutch pedal is depressed.<br /></li><li type="1">The select lever is shifted to the "N" position.<br /></li><li type="1">The vehicle speed becomes approximately 40 km&#47;h or less. <br /></li><li type="1">The vehicle speed is decreased by 15 km&#47;h or more from the starting speed

be suspended until the system returns to normal condition. Also, one of the following conditions
is met, a constant speed driving is cancelled immediately.<br /><b></b><br /><ul><li type="1">An abnormality occurs in the auto-cruise control switch.<br /></li><li type="1">An abnormality occurs in the stoplight signal.<br /></li></ul>When one of the following conditions is met, unless the vehicle is stopped to turn the
ignition switch to the "LOCK" (OFF) position, the auto-cruise control system function will be
suspended even if the system returns to the normal state. Also, one of the following conditions
is met, a constant speed driving is cancelled immediately.<br /><b></b><br /><ul><li type="1">Engine-ECU &#60;4M4&#62; abnormality or engine-A&#47;T-ECU
