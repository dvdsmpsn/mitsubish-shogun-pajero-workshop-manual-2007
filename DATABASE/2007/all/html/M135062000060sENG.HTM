            </b>The ASTC control brake pressure with the help of the ECU&#8217;s. Therefore, although the phenomena described in the following table may occur, they should not be regarded as faults because they are generated in a normal operation of ASTC system.<br /><table class="fonttbl5" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b>Symptom<br /></b></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b>Explanation of symptom<br /></b></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">When the engine is started, light noise such as "clicking" sound may be generated from the engine room.<br /></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">This system is performing operation check, and this is not abnormal.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b></b><br /><ul><li type="1">According to ABS or ASTC operation, the brake pedal feeling change (for example shorter stroke, firmer than usual), operation noise and vibration will occur.<br /></li><li type="1">Operation noises and vibration occurs from the chassis parts because ABS and ASTC operations wheel brakes that fixed to these parts.

            </b>For road surfaces such as snow-covered roads and gravel roads, the braking distance for vehicles with ABS can sometimes be longer than that for other vehicles. Accordingly, advise the customer to drive safely on such roads by lowering the vehicle speed and not being too overconfident.<br /><b>3.
            </b>Diagnosis detection condition can vary depending on the diagnosis code. Make sure that checking requirements listed in the "Comment" are satisfied when checking the trouble symptom again.<br /></body></html>
