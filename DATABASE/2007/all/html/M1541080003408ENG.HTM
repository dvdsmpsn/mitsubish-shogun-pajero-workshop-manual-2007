Procedure 6: Mixed with Noise, Only at Night (AM).</h1><br /></h1><p align="right" STYLE="font-size:09pt; font-family:Arial;">M15410800034ENG0000010000</p><BR /><hr width="90%" />The following factors can be considered as possible causes of noise appearing
at night.<br /><b>1.
            </b>Factors due to signal conditions: Due to the fact that long-distance signals are more
easily received at night, even stations that are received without problem during the day may
experience interference in a general worsening of reception conditions. The weaker a station
is the more susceptible it is to interference, and a change to different station or the appearance
of a beating sound&#42; may occur.<br /><table class="fontattn" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td class="" bgcolor="#aaaaff" width="60"><b>note</b></td><td bgcolor="#aaaaff">Beat sound&#42;: Two signals close in frequency interfere with each other, creating
a repetitious high-pitched sound. This sound is generated not only by sound signals but electrical waves
as well.<br /></td></tr></table><b>2.
            </b>Factors due to vehicles noise: Alternator noise may be a cause.<br /><br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>DIAGNOSIS PROCEDURE</h2><br /><a name="S1"></a><b>STEP 1. Check that the noise still obvious even when the
