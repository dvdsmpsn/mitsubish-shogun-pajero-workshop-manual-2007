from various sensors. The fuel injection amount is determined by the length of the actuation
time of the solenoid valve in the injector. The longer the actuation time of the solenoid valve,
the greater the fuel injection amount will be. Conversely, the shorter the actuation time of
the solenoid valve, the smaller the injection amount will be.<br /><br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/13/ZK602559AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/13/ZK602559AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br /><br />Basically, the fuel injection amount is calculated in accordance with the accelerator
position and the engine speed. However, the calculated value varies by shift position. The following
compensations are added to the calculated value in order to calculate the fuel injection amount
that suits the driving conditions. Furthermore, the calculated fuel injection amount and the
rail pressure are used to determine the actuation time of the injectors.<br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>List of main compensations for fuel injection amount control</h3><br /><table class="fonttbl5" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b>Compensations<br /></b></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b>Content<br /></b></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Maximum fuel injection amount restriction<br /></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">The maximum fuel injection amount is the upper limit of the fuel

timing during the compression stroke. The engine-ECU compares the crank angle sensor signal
with the camshaft position sensor signal to identify the cylinder. Based on this information,
the engine-ECU performs the sequential injection to the each cylinder in the order of No. 1,
No. 3, No. 4 and No. 2 cylinder. Basically, the fuel injection timing is calculated in accordance with
the engine speed and the target injection amount. To this value, the following compensations are
added to calculate the fuel injection timing that suits the driving conditions. Engine-ECU actuates the
injectors at the calculated fuel injection timing.<br /><br /><a name=""></a><hr width="70%" /><h3>List of main compensations for fuel injection timing control</h3><br /><table class="fonttbl5" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b>Compensations<br /></b></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b>Content<br /></b></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Engine coolant temperature compensation<br /></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">This compensation is made to suit the engine coolant temperature.
