Due to differences in AM and FM systems, AM is more susceptible
to noise interference.<br /><a name="S1"></a><b>STEP 1. Check that there is noise under the following
state(s).</b><h1></h1><b></b><br /><ul><li type="1">A motorcycle was passing.<br /></li><li type="1">Lighting was flashing.<br /></li><li type="1">A vehicle passed close by, but it appeared to be a vehicle generating a particularly
large amount of noise radiation.<br /></li><li type="1">Passed beneath a power line.<br /></li><li type="1">Passed beneath a telephone line.<br /></li><li type="1">Passed close by a signal alternator.<br /></li><li type="1">Passed close by some other sources of electrical noise.<br /></li><li type="1">Passed under a bridge.<br /></li></ul><h3>Q.

worse than other radios, consult a service centre.<br /><a href="#S3"><img src="../../../BUTTONS/03btn002.png" /></a>Go to Step 3.<br /><a name="S3"></a><b>STEP 3. Check noise prevention on the radio side is difficult.</b><h1></h1><h3>Q.
          Is the noise level worse than other radios?</h3><img src="../../../BUTTONS/03btn001.png" />Consult a service centre. Noise encountered during FM reception only. Due to differences
in FM and AM systems, FM is not as susceptible as AM to interference from engines, power lines,
lighting, etc. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of FM waves, there are sometimes
cases of noise or distortion which are generated by typical noise interference (first fading
and multipath). Noise (hissing) occurs in weak signal areas such as mountainous regions, but
this is not due to Furthermore, the amount of interference will be comparatively less for vehicles
equipped with a diversity antenna system&#42;. If there is an equivalent amount of distortion
in vehicles or radios of the same type, then differences will be because of differences in antenna
systems, and this should be explained to the user. a problem with the radio. Furthermore, the amount
