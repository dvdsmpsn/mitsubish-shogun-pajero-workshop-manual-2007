operator's intention) through the accelerator pedal position sensor. Based on pre-set basic
target opening angles it adds various compensations and controls the throttle valve opening
angle according to the target opening angle.<br /><b></b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/13/ZK600293AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/13/ZK600293AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>While starting</h2><br />Engine-A/T-ECU adds various compensations to the target opening angle that are set based
on the engine coolant temperature, so that the air volume is optimum for starting.<br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>While idling</h2><br />Engine-A/T-ECU controls the throttle valve to achieve the target opening angle that are
set based on the engine coolant temperature. In this way best idle operation is achieved when
engine is cold and when it is hot. Also, the following compensations ensure optimum control.<br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>While driving</h2><br />Compensations are made to the target opening angle set according to the accelerator pedal
opening angle and engine speed to control the throttle valve opening angle.<br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>List of main compensations for throttle valve opening angle and idle speed
control</h2><br /><table class="fonttbl5" border="1" width="100%"><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b>Compensations<br /></b></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN"><b>Content<br /></b></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Stable idle compensation (immediately after start)<br /></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">In order to stabilize idle speed immediately after start, target

engine coolant temperature.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Rotation speed feedback compensation (while idling)<br /></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">In case there is a difference between the target idle speed and actual
engine speed, engine-A/T-ECU compensates the throttle valve opening angle based on that difference.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Atmospheric pressure compensation<br /></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">At high altitudes atmospheric pressure is less and the intake air
density is low. So, the target opening angle is compensated based on atmospheric pressure.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Engine coolant temperature compensation<br /></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Compensation is made according to the engine coolant temperature.
The lower the engine coolant temperature the greater the throttle valve opening angle.<br /></td></tr><tr><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Electric load compensation<br /></td><td valign="" colspan="NaN" rowspan="NaN">Throttle opening angle is compensated according to electric load.

position to fully open position and records the fully closed/open studied value of the throttle
position sensor (main and sub) output signals. The recorded studied values are used as studied
value compensation for compensating basic target opening angle when the engine is started next.<br /></body></html>
