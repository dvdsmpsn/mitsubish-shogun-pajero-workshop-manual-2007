valve to control inlet manifold negative pressure that acts on the vacuum actuator. As a result,
the control valve in the secondary port is opened / closed.<br /><b>System Configuration Diagram</b><br /><a href="javascript:enlarge('../../../IMG/13/ZK600298AA00ALL.png')"><img class="imgtbl505" width="505" src="../../../IMG/13/ZK600298AA00ALL.png"></img></a><br />When the engine is at low speed and operated with a high load, engine-A/T-ECU turns ON
the variable induction control solenoid valve. As a result, inlet manifold negative pressure
acts on vacuum actuator and control valve is closed. When the engine is not at low speed and
not operated with a high load, engine-A/T-ECU turns OFF the variable induction control solenoid
valve. As a result, the inside of the vacuum actuator comes to atmospheric pressure and the control
valve opens.<br /></body></html>
