adding a small amount of metallic elements, including magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu) and silicon
(Si), to aluminium. This type of aluminium material has equivalent strength to cold rolled steel
sheets.<br /><hr width="90%" /><h2>Advantage of aluminium panel</h2><br /><b>1.
            </b>Lighter: The specific gravity of aluminium is 2.7, which is only one third of general
steel panel (7.9). However, it requires 1.4 times in thickness to obtain the same rigidity as
the steel panel, resulting in one half in weight.<br /><b>2.
            </b>More durable: Aluminium has the property of creating oxide coating on its surface
when it contacts with the air. This coating prevents it from being corroded.<br /><b>3.
            </b>More heat-conductive: The heat conductivity of aluminium is twice as high as that
of iron. This means that aluminium absorbs and disperses heat more quickly, which results in
prompt change of its temperature.<br /><b>4.
            </b>More electric-conductive<br /><b>5.
            </b>Non-magnetic substance<br /></body></html>
